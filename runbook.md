## Alert Types and Response Actions

### 1. Failover Detected Alert

**What it means:**
Traffic has automatically switched from one pool to another (Blueâ†’Green or Greenâ†’Blue).

**Alert Example:**
```
ðŸ”„ FAILOVER Alert
Failover Detected!
- From: blue
- To: green
Action Required: Check health of blue container
```

**Operator Actions:**
1. Check container health:
```bash
   docker compose ps
   docker compose logs app_blue
```

2. If container is down, restart it:
```bash
   docker compose restart app_blue
```

3. Monitor for automatic recovery after 5 seconds

---

### 2. High Error Rate Alert

**What it means:**
The upstream services are returning too many 5xx errors (> threshold%).

**Alert Example:**
```
ðŸš¨ ERROR Alert
High Error Rate Detected!
- Error Rate: 5.2%
- Threshold: 2%
- Window: Last 200 requests
Action Required: Check upstream health and logs
```

**Operator Actions:**
1. Check container health:
```bash
   docker compose ps
```

2. Check application logs:
```bash
   docker compose logs app_blue
   docker compose logs app_green
```

3. Check Nginx logs:
```bash
   docker compose exec nginx tail -n 50 /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

## Maintenance Mode

To suppress alerts during planned maintenance:
```bash
# Enable maintenance mode
nano .env
# Set: MAINTENANCE_MODE=true

# Restart watcher
docker compose restart alert_watcher
```

## Manual Failover Testing
```bash
# 1. Check current pool
curl -I http://localhost:8080/version | grep X-App-Pool

# 2. Trigger chaos
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/chaos/start?mode=error

# 3. Watch for failover alert in Slack

# 4. Verify traffic switched
curl -I http://localhost:8080/version | grep X-App-Pool

# 5. Stop chaos
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/chaos/stop
```
